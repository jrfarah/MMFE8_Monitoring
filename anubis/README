# ANUBIS
# Program for monitoring low voltage power source in real time and over entire runs
# Created by Joseph Farah

# Last updated: [Friday, September 1st, 2017] by [Joseph Farah]
# Requires several files to run:
#   * db_loc.txt: contains a single line pointing both ANUBIS and the Matlab script 
#                 to the correct database  
#   * speed_run.m: a minimized data collection script, needs to be running while the 
#                  run is going
# 	* graphing/: contains the code needed to use ROOT to graph the entire dataset
#
# Function arguments: 
#   * --rnum: the current run number, defaults to "notrun" if none is provided
#   * --threshold: the maximum voltage allowed before the program proceeds to 
#                  piss itself
#	* --lower: the minimum voltage allowed before the program alerts
#	* --emails: the list of emails, separated by commas
# 	* --user: the username for the alert system (must be gmail)
#	* --pass: the password for the alert system account
#	* --totref: time interal between the total dataset graph refreshes
# 	* --nographs: NO ARGUMENT, doesn't display all graphs on startup
#	* --startnow: starts the matlab script automatically and displays graphs
#
# Example commands: 
# 	(1) To begin run 3522 immediately, begin monitoring immediately, display 
#		graphs, give two emails, provide upper and lower thresholds, and wait 5 minutes in between each total graph 
#		refresh: 
# python anubis.py --rnum 3522 --threshold 1.0 --lower 0.2 --user lppcautomated --pass 42oxford --totref 300000 --startnow --emails email@email.ch,another@email.ch
#
#	(2) To run the program and do everything from the GUI:
# python anubis.py
#
# IMPORTANT: DO NOT RUN THE MATLAB SCRIPT IN ANY WAY BEFORE A DATABASE HAS BEEN GENERATED FOR THE RUN.
